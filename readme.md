## To deploy a Terraform workflow on Azure using GitHub, you will need to follow these steps:

### 1. Install the Azure CLI on your system if you do not already have it installed.

2. Sign in to Azure using the Azure CLI by running the following command:

Copy code

```
az login
```
3. Create a resource group for your Terraform deployment by running the following command:

Copy code

```
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus
```
4. Create an Azure service principal by running the following command:

Copy code
```
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name myServicePrincipal
```
5. Save the output of the previous command, as you will need the appId, password, and tenant values later.

6. Create a Terraform configuration file (e.g. main.tf) that describes the infrastructure you want to deploy on Azure.

7. Create a GitHub repository and add your Terraform configuration file to it.

8. Create a new GitHub workflow by creating a file named .github/workflows/terraform.yml in your repository.

9. Add the following YAML code to the terraform.yml file to configure the workflow:

10. In the repository settings, go to the "Secrets" section and create the following secrets:

AZURE_CREDENTIALS: A JSON string containing the appId, password, and tenant values obtained in step 4.
AZURE_CLIENT_ID: The appId value obtained in step 4.
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: The password value obtained in step 4.
AZURE_TENANT_ID: The tenant value obtained in step 4.
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: The ID of the Azure subscription that you want to    use for the deployment.
11. Push your changes to the GitHub repository. The workflow will automatically run and deploy your Terraform configuration to Azure.
